## IBM Kubernetes Service Workshop

In the workshop you will learn about foundational open source technologies and industry-wide accepted best practices for building modern, scalable, portable, and robust applications. You will learn about deploying and managing microservice applications on top of the IBM Kubernetes Service (IKS) environment. We will also discuess some of the most common pitfalls to watch out for.
