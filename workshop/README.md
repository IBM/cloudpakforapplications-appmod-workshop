## App Modernization Workshop

In the workshop you will learn about foundational open source technologies and OpenShift for building modern, scalable, portable, and robust applications. We will be focusing on the developer experience in OpenShift, and tricks you can employ to spend less time configuring environments and getting things working and more time coding.
