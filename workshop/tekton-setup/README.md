# Tekton Lab 0

This section is broken up into the following steps:

1. [Log into OpenShift](#2-log-into-openshift)
1. [Install Tekton CLI](#3-install-tekton-cli)

## 1. Log into OpenShift

You will need to authenticate with the OpenShift console before continuing.

From the [IBM Cloud Home Page](https://cloud.ibm.com), make sure you are in the IBM Cloud account where your cluster is located. Select from the dropdown menu in the upper right.

Follow the instructions including logging in using your IBM ID to get the command to login. Run the command in your IBM Cloud Shell environment

```console
oc login --token=... --server=...
```
